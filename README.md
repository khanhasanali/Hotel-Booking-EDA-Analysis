# Hotel-Booking-EDA-Analysis

I'm sharing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Visualisation of Hotel Bookings Demand data using SQL and Power BI.

About the Project


In this project, I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis using SQL and Visualisation by Power BI.

To conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA), I need to be able to come up with the right questions to start the process. These questions will help me keep my mind on track and set my expectations.

For this Dataset, I have divided it into three main parts
 Hotel
 Bookings 
 Customers
 and come up with a total of 9 questions and 3 questions each
