### Analysis Questions

Our analysis consists of 3 main parts Bookings, Hotels and Customers. <br/> <br/>

Hotels:

- What are the most popular hotels and how many bookings they have had over the year?
- Compare those hotels on the type of customers.

Customers:

* What is the trend of customer requests during their stay in different room types?
